# a collection of my work

## description
This webpage features works in progress and works completed, but could always be improved! Website features include hover photo that links to that specific project, good use of Bulma CSS to bring together colors and shapes, and most of all, personality! This portfolio will continue to improve as my knowledge of front and back end thrives in my career. I hope you are able to see what I've learned and what I've discovered as I move further into technology, old and new.

## installation & usage
